  b.1.Company Overview (Why the Enterprise System Was Implemented)

    Coca-Cola Enterprises faced challenges in managing its global operations due to multiple disconnected legacy systems, which caused inefficiencies, inconsistent data, and slow decision-making across departments like manufacturing, supply chain, and sales. To address these issues, Coca-Cola Enterprises implemented SAP, an integrated ERP system, to unify its operations, enhance supply chain management, improve production efficiency, and provide real-time access to business-critical data, enabling faster responses to market changes and more informed decision-making.
