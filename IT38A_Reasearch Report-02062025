b. Case Study 1: Successful Enterprise System Implementation

  b.1.Company Overview (Why the Enterprise System Was Implemented)

    Coca-Cola Enterprises faced challenges in managing its global operations due to multiple disconnected legacy systems, which caused inefficiencies, inconsistent data, and slow decision-making across departments like manufacturing, supply chain, and sales. To address these issues, Coca-Cola Enterprises implemented SAP, an integrated ERP system, to unify its operations, enhance supply chain management, improve production efficiency, and provide real-time access to business-critical data, enabling faster responses to market changes and more informed decision-making.

 b.2. Implementation Process
 
 Coca-Cola Enterprises implemented SAP in several steps. First, they assessed their systems and found areas to improve, like inventory and orders. After choosing SAP for its flexibility, they customized it for their needs. Then, they moved data from old systems to SAP and trained employees on how to use it. After testing, SAP went live, and the company kept an eye on its performance to make improvements.
